    "## Introduction to SpaCy\n",
    "SpaCy is one of the main libraries for NLP in Python. It is especially tailored towards the (development and) deployment of pipelines for a number of NLP tasks, from named entity recognition to dependency parsing. Recent additions to spaCy also make it possible to use advanced models (LLMs) as building block for such pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore some of SpaCy's basic functionality. As we will mainly focus on understanding and implementing methods to represent and generate text, we will not be using SpaCy extensively for the rest of the course -- but it is a great tool for many applications, and it has wonderful documentation.\n",

    "You may need to install this first (I am using `spacy==3.6.1`) -- add it to your requirements file if you have one."

      "conversation--\"I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are\n",
      "distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don't\n",

      "Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That\n",

      "natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth\n",

      "\"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father\n",

      "the head that he was considering this information.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know,\" he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad\n",
      "current of his thoughts, \"that Anatole is costing me forty thousand\n",
      "rubles a year? And,\" he went on after a pause, \"what will it be in five\n",
      "years, if he goes on like this?\" Presently he added: \"That's what we\n",
      "fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the\n",
      "well-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the\n",
      "late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the King of Prussia.' He is very clever\n",
      "but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a\n",

      "Prince Vasili's daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her father\n",

      "lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she\n",

      "who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a\n",

      "\"You think so?\" rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and get\n",
      "away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a\n",
      "reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had\n",
      "finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who\n",
      "wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart,\n",

      "\n",
      "And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she\n",
      "resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready\n",
      "to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the\n",
      "foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes\n",
      "round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that\n",
      "creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the\n",

      "proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about\n",

      "in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any\n",
      "clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and\n",
      "refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting\n",
      "to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the\n",

      "steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,\n",
      "beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face\n",
      "was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had\n",
      "settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the\n",
      "abbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess\n",
      "Helene, Prince Vasili's daughter, and the little Princess Bolkonskaya,\n",
      "very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third\n",
      "group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished\n",
      "manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of\n",
      "politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in\n",
      "which he found himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a\n",
      "treat to her guests. As a clever maitre d'hotel serves up as a specially\n",
      "choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the\n",
      "kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served up to her\n",
      "guests, first the vicomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly choice\n",
      "morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the\n",
      "murder of the Duc d'Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d'Enghien had\n",
      "perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons\n",
      "for Buonaparte's hatred of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,\" said Anna Pavlovna, with a\n",

      "\n",
      "The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The vicomte knew the duc personally,\" whispered Anna Pavlovna to one of\n",

      "\"How evidently he belongs to the best society,\" said she to a third; and\n",
      "the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most\n",

      "The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which\n",
      "she had first entered the room--the smile of a perfectly beautiful\n",
      "woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and\n",
      "ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling\n",
      "diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking\n",
      "at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the\n",
      "privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back,\n",
      "and bosom--which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed--\n",
      "and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved\n",
      "toward Anna Pavlovna. Helene was so lovely that not only did she not\n",
      "show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy of\n",
      "her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She seemed to wish,\n",
      "but to be unable, to diminish its effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How lovely!\" said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his\n",
      "shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary\n",
      "when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her\n",
      "unchanging smile.\n",

      "\"Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,\" said he, smilingly\n",
      "inclining his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered\n",
      "a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was\n",
      "being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,\n",
      "altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more\n",
      "beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time\n",
      "to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story\n",
      "produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna, at once adopted just\n",
      "the expression she saw on the maid of honor's face, and again relapsed\n",
      "into her radiant smile.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Now I am all right,\" she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she\n",
      "took up her work.\n",

      "Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to\n",
      "his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of this\n",
      "resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his\n",
      "sister's, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-\n",
      "satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the\n",
      "wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was\n",
      "dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-\n",
      "confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth\n",
      "all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and\n",
      "legs always fell into unnatural positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not going to be a ghost story?\" said he, sitting down beside the\n",
      "princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this\n",
      "instrument he could not begin to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why no, my dear fellow,\" said the astonished narrator, shrugging his\n",
      "shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I hate ghost stories,\" said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which\n",
      "showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had\n",
      "uttered them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure\n",
      "whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a\n",
      "dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe\n",
      "effrayee, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,\n",
      "to the effect that the Duc d'Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit\n",
      "Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also\n",
      "enjoyed the famous actress' favors, and that in his presence Napoleon\n",
      "happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject,\n",
      "and was thus at the duc's mercy. The latter spared him, and this\n",
      "magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.\n",

      "watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was\n",
      "talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe, so she hurried to the\n",
      "rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe about\n",
      "the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young\n",
      "man's simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were\n",
      "talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna\n",
      "Pavlovna disapproved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The means are... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the\n",
      "people,\" the abbe was saying. \"It is only necessary for one powerful\n",
      "nation like Russia--barbaric as she is said to be--to place herself\n",
      "disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the\n",

      "At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,\n",
      "asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian's face\n",

      "\"I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the\n",

      "offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was\n",
      "evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had\n",

      "Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized\n",

      "hopeless: \"The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis XVII,\n",
      "for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!\" and he became more\n",
      "animated. \"And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal\n",

      "\"The Emperor Alexander,\" said she, with the melancholy which always\n",

      "he was justified in saying so.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation\n",
      "of the vicomte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The execution of the Duc d'Enghien,\" declared Monsieur Pierre, \"was a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! Oh!\" exclaimed several voices.\n",
      "\n",

      "The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his\n",
      "audience over his spectacles and continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say so,\" he continued desperately, \"because the Bourbons fled from\n",
      "the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone\n",

      "he could not stop short for the sake of one man's life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't you come over to the other table?\" suggested Anna Pavlovna.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No,\" cried he, becoming more and more eager, \"Napoleon is great because\n",
      "he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all\n",
      "that was good in it--equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and\n",
      "of the press--and only for that reason did he obtain power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might rid\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But\n",

      "\"I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,\" again interjected an\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important.\n",
      "What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices,\n",
      "and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained\n",
      "in full force.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Liberty and equality,\" said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last\n",
      "deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were,\n",
      "\"high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love\n",
      "liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality.\n",
      "Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We\n",
      "wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the\n",
      "vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of\n",
      "Pierre's outburst Anna Pavlovna, despite her social experience, was\n",
      "horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre's sacrilegious words had not\n",
      "exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was\n",
      "impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in\n",
      "a vigorous attack on the orator.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,\" said she, \"how do you explain the fact\n",
      "of a great man executing a duc--or even an ordinary man who--is innocent\n",
      "and untried?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like,\" said the vicomte, \"to ask how monsieur explains the\n",

      "all like the conduct of a great man!\"\n",

      "\"He's a low fellow, say what you will,\" remarked Prince Hippolyte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His\n",
      "smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled, his\n",
      "grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by another-\n",
      "-a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to ask\n",
      "forgiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this\n",

      "silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you expect him to answer you all at once?\" said Prince Andrew.\n",
      "\"Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between\n",

      "seems to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, of course!\" Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this\n",
      "reinforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One must admit,\" continued Prince Andrew, \"that Napoleon as a man was\n",
      "great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he\n",
      "gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but... but there are other acts\n",
      "which it is difficult to justify.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of\n",
      "Pierre's remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to\n",
      "go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,\n",
      "and asking them all to be seated began:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.\n",
      "Excuse me, Vicomte--I must tell it in Russian or the point will be\n",
      "lost....\" And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian\n",
      "as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.\n",
      "Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their\n",
      "attention to his story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must\n",
      "have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her\n",
      "taste. And she had a lady's maid, also big. She said...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with\n",
      "difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She said... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the maid, 'put on a livery,\n",
      "get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his\n",
      "audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several\n",
      "persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pavlovna, did however\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and\n",
      "her long hair came down....\" Here he could contain himself no longer and\n",
      "went on, between gasps of laughter: \"And the whole world knew....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told\n",
      "it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pavlovna and the\n",
      "others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's social tact in so agreeably ending\n",
      "Pierre's unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote the\n",
      "conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and\n",
      "next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and\n",

      "Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began\n",
      "to take their leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge\n",
      "red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing\n",
      "room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something\n",
      "particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was absent-\n",
      "minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the general's\n",
      "three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the general\n",
      "asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and inability to\n",
      "enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by his kindly,\n",
      "simple, and modest expression. Anna Pavlovna turned toward him and, with\n",
      "a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion,\n",
      "nodded and said: \"I hope to see you again, but I also hope you will\n",

      "\n",
      "When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody\n",

      "everyone, including Anna Pavlovna, felt this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to\n",
      "the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened\n",
      "indifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also\n",
      "come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,\" said the little princess,\n",

      "understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual\n",
      "spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.\n",
      "\n",

      "pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from\n",
      "awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the\n",

      "though embracing her.\n",

      "affectionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte\n",

      "\n",
      "Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew's study like one\n",
      "quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took\n",

      "The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as\n",
      "fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a\n",
      "chair for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is it,\" she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and\n",

      "that we women don't want anything of the kind, don't need it? Now you\n",
      "shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is Uncle's aide-de-\n",

      "Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,\n",
      "with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That's my advice: never marry till\n",

      "until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her\n",
      "plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable\n",
      "mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing--or all that is\n",
      "good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles.\n",
      "Yes! Yes! Yes! Don't look at me with such surprise. If you marry\n",

      "Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My wife,\" continued Prince Andrew, \"is an excellent woman, one of those\n",
      "rare women with whom a man's honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not\n",

      "\n",
      "As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkonski who\n",
      "had lolled in Anna Pavlovna's easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had\n",
      "uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face\n",
      "was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire\n",
      "of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. It\n",
      "was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more\n",
      "impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't understand why I say this,\" he continued, \"but it is the\n",
      "whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,\" said he\n",
      "(though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), \"but Bonaparte when he\n",
      "worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing\n",
      "but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with a\n",
      "woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you\n",
      "have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with\n",
      "regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality--these are\n",
      "the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war,\n",
      "the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for\n",
      "nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,\" continued Prince\n",
      "Andrew, \"and at Anna Pavlovna's they listen to me. And that stupid set\n",
      "without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women... If you only knew\n",
      "what those society women are, and women in general! My father is right.\n",
      "Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everything--that's what women are when\n",
      "you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it\n",

      "model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest\n",
      "degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best\n",
      "described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at Prince\n",
      "Andrew's calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory,\n",
      "his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had\n",
      "an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for work and\n",
      "study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew's lack of capacity for\n",
      "philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly\n",
      "addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of\n",
      "strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My part is played out,\" said Prince Andrew. \"What's the use of talking\n",

      "his reassuring thoughts.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "a careless, merry smile. \"What am I? An illegitimate son!\" He suddenly\n",
      "blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say\n",
      "this. \"Without a name and without means... And it really...\" But he did\n",
      "not say what \"it really\" was. \"For the present I am free and am all\n",

      "consult you seriously.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance--friendly and\n",
      "affectionate as it was--expressed a sense of his own superiority.\n",

      "impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to\n",
      "see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or\n",
      "evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kuragin\n",
      "was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there\n",

      "that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his\n",
      "promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he\n",
      "had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; \"besides,\"\n",
      "thought he, \"all such 'words of honor' are conventional things with no\n",

      "be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and\n",
      "dishonor will be all the same!\" Pierre often indulged in reflections of\n",
      "this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to\n",

      "Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards' barracks, in which\n",

      "laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and\n",
      "general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously\n",

      "left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and placed\n",
      "them on the window sill, though it was already quite light. Dolokhov's\n",
      "back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both\n",

      "Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle\n",
      "and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand\n",
      "to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some\n",
      "broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the\n",
      "window and from Dolokhov's back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes.\n",
      "The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had\n",
      "wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself\n",
      "on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a\n",
      "faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and\n",
      "fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes. Dolokhov\n",
      "still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back\n",
      "till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the\n",
      "bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The\n",
      "bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head\n",
      "tilting yet further back. \"Why is it so long?\" thought Pierre. It seemed\n",
      "to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dolokhov made a\n",
      "backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this\n",
      "was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping\n",
      "ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more\n",
      "with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill, but\n",
      "refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he\n",
      "would never open them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around.\n",
